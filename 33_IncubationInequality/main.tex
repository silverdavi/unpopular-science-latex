The Gaussian distribution, also called the normal distribution, is defined by the density function
\[
\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2},
\]
which describes the probability of observing a real-valued outcome \( x \) centered at zero. The function is symmetric about the origin, with values decreasing smoothly as \( |x| \) increases. The rate of decay is exponential in the square of the distance, causing values far from zero to be exponentially rare. The total area under the curve is normalized to one, making it a valid probability distribution. Its characteristic bell shape makes it the canonical model for random variation in a wide range of natural and statistical systems.

This bell curve emerges as the limiting form of many sums of random variables. Consider a process of repeatedly rolling a fair die and averaging the results. Although each individual roll yields a uniformly distributed outcome on a discrete set, the distribution of the average becomes increasingly smooth and Gaussian as the number of trials grows. This phenomenon is formalized by the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum (or average) of independent, identically distributed variables with finite variance converges in distribution to the Gaussian, regardless of the original shape. The theorem explains why Gaussian distributions appear so ubiquitously in statistical mechanics, measurement theory, and signal processing.

The multivariate Gaussian generalizes this structure to \( \mathbb{R}^n \). The standard form has density
\[
\varphi_n(x) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}} e^{-\|x\|^2/2},
\]
where \( \|x\| \) is the Euclidean norm of the vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \). This distribution is spherically symmetric: it assigns equal probability density to all points equidistant from the origin. Its contours are concentric spheres, and its value depends only on the radial distance. Moreover, every linear projection of this distribution onto a one-dimensional axis yields a standard univariate Gaussian. If the coordinate axes are orthogonal, then each component of \( x \) is independent and identically distributed. These properties — rotational invariance and marginal stability — make the multivariate Gaussian a uniquely tractable object in high-dimensional probability.

In high dimensions, the geometry of Gaussian measure becomes unintuitive. Although the density is highest at the origin, the bulk of the probability mass concentrates near a thin spherical shell of radius approximately \( \sqrt{n} \). This occurs because volume in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) increases so rapidly with radius that it outweighs the decay of the density. Most randomly drawn points lie far from the center, despite the central peak. This phenomenon, known as concentration of measure, turns probabilistic problems into geometric ones. Understanding whether a Gaussian random vector lies in a given region requires analyzing how that region intersects a nearly fixed-radius shell, rather than focusing on values near the origin.

The Gaussian Correlation Inequality concerns the probability that a standard Gaussian random vector \( X \in \mathbb{R}^n \) simultaneously falls into two geometric regions. Let \( A \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) and \( B \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) be closed, convex sets that are symmetric about the origin. Then the inequality states:
\[
\mathbb{P}(X \in A \cap B) \geq \mathbb{P}(X \in A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(X \in B).
\]
The left-hand side is the probability that a single Gaussian sample lies in both sets, while the right-hand side is the product of the probabilities of lying in each separately. No notion of parametric correlation appears in this formulation — no Pearson coefficient, no covariance matrix interaction. The term “correlation” here is geometric: it measures the extent to which the spatial configurations of the sets align so that overlap under the Gaussian measure is enhanced. The inequality asserts that symmetric convex structure interacts positively under Gaussian sampling.

To visualize the situation, imagine a dartboard in high-dimensional space. Two target zones — each convex and mirror-symmetric about the center — are drawn on the board. The dart is thrown not with uniform probability, but according to a Gaussian distribution: more likely to land near the center, less likely to reach the periphery. Because the Gaussian density favors central regions and penalizes outliers, the probability of a dart simultaneously hitting both targets is enhanced if those targets are symmetrically and convexly shaped. Convexity ensures no internal gaps; symmetry ensures central balance. The Gaussian Correlation Inequality formalizes this intuition: overlapping convex structures capture more of the central mass jointly than one would predict by multiplying their marginal probabilities.

Both symmetry and convexity are essential to the validity of the inequality. If either condition is relaxed, the result can fail. For example, consider two non-convex shapes such as disconnected spherical caps placed symmetrically on opposite sides of the origin. Each may individually capture moderate Gaussian mass, but their intersection can be empty, rendering the left-hand side of the inequality zero while the right-hand side remains positive. Alternatively, take two convex balls shifted away from the origin in opposite directions: each maintains convexity, but the loss of symmetry means their overlap under Gaussian measure can be arbitrarily small, violating the inequality. The Gaussian Correlation Inequality depends not just on the shape of the sets but on how those shapes are embedded relative to the measure's symmetry.

The inequality admits several equivalent formulations. One version expresses the result in terms of indicator functions:
\[
\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}_A(X) \cdot \mathbf{1}_B(X)] \geq \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}_A(X)] \cdot \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}_B(X)],
\]
emphasizing the inequality as a statement about non-negative correlation of indicator functions under the Gaussian measure. Another version involves functions beyond indicators: if \( f \) and \( g \) are symmetric, log-concave functions, then the inequality
\[
\mathbb{E}[f(X)g(X)] \geq \mathbb{E}[f(X)] \cdot \mathbb{E}[g(X)]
\]
holds under similar geometric constraints. These restatements reveal a structural principle: under Gaussian sampling, overlap is not merely tolerated but amplified when sets or functions obey regularity conditions aligned with the geometry of the distribution.

The Gaussian Correlation Inequality was conjectured in the 1950s and resisted proof for over six decades. During this time, it was confirmed in numerous special cases. When the sets \( A \) and \( B \) were coordinate-aligned boxes, the inequality followed from the FKG inequality and properties of product measures. For slabs — regions bounded by parallel hyperplanes — the result could be derived from the structure of marginal distributions. Ellipsoids offered another tractable case due to their spectral alignment with the Gaussian’s rotational symmetry. Despite this progress, no general method succeeded. Classical techniques — log-concavity of Gaussian measure, the Brascamp–Lieb inequality, and concentration of measure phenomena — yielded related inequalities but stopped short of establishing the required correlation bound for arbitrary convex symmetric sets. The geometric regularity of the sets and the measure suggested the inequality should hold, but no known machinery could bridge the gap.

The proof came not from a major probabilist or a high-profile research program, but from Thomas Royen, a retired statistician at a university of applied sciences in Bingen, Germany. Royen had worked for decades in applied statistics, particularly in pharmaceutical research. His academic career was spent outside the core research institutions of probability theory, and his publication record was modest by conventional standards. Yet this outsider status provided something rare: the freedom to pursue classical problems without disciplinary constraint. Royen’s mathematical training was solid but practical, shaped by applications and shaped by clarity rather than trend. He approached the problem of Gaussian correlation not as a convex analyst but as a statistician with an eye for transformations and distributions.

The central move in Royen’s proof was to reframe the inequality in terms of squared Gaussian variables. By passing to variables of the form \( X_i^2 \), he translated the problem into one involving sums of independent gamma-distributed variables. This transformation allowed the introduction of Laplace transforms — a standard tool in distributional analysis — and reduced the problem to showing monotonicity of a certain function defined by determinants of parameter-dependent covariance matrices. Royen employed an identity involving the determinant of a positive semi-definite matrix perturbed by diagonal terms, and used it to establish the required inequality via monotonicity in a parameter. The argument was elementary in the sense that it involved no deep theorems, but subtle in its reconfiguration of the problem into a tractable analytic form.

Despite the proof’s correctness, Royen’s paper initially went unnoticed. It appeared in a minor journal and lacked the formal polish typically expected of breakthroughs in high-dimensional analysis. The title and abstract did not signal its significance, and the style — direct and sparse — obscured its novelty. For a time, the result was known only to a small circle of readers, many of whom were unsure whether the argument was valid. Eventually, experts in probability and convex geometry began to scrutinize the proof, rephrasing and streamlining its components. Within a few years, the result was confirmed, disseminated, and reformulated in the language of convex analysis and Gaussian processes. Royen’s name entered the canonical history of the problem, and the Gaussian Correlation Inequality was marked solved. What remained was not only a resolution of the inequality itself, but a reminder that the landscape of mathematical solutions includes not only new theories, but new configurations of old tools — found sometimes at the margins of the research world.

\begin{commentary}[Unexpected Solvers with Familiar Tools]
This story joins others in this book where longstanding open problems were resolved not by new machinery, but by the careful use of classical methods in unfamiliar configurations — often by researchers outside elite institutions. Like Yitang Zhang’s breakthrough on bounded prime gaps, or the amateur discovery of the monotile known as the “hat,” Thomas Royen’s proof of the Gaussian Correlation Inequality relied on known identities and transforms applied with unusual directness. These cases share a common structure: problems that resisted decades of expert attention gave way once the right pathway — already present in the mathematical landscape — was followed with precision.
