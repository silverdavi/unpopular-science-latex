Torricelli's Trumpet, generated by rotating y=1/x around the x-axis for x≥1, illustrates how geometric intuition breaks down with infinite objects. This solid extends infinitely yet contains a finite volume of exactly π cubic units, as proven through integration. Simultaneously, its surface area is infinite, creating the apparent paradox that the trumpet could be filled with a finite amount of paint yet never painted completely. The divergence occurs because volume scales with the square of radius while surface area scales linearly with radius as x approaches infinity.
