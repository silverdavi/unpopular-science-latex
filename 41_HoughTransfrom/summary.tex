The Hough transform detects geometric patterns in images by converting the problem from image space to parameter space. Digital images, represented as discrete intensity functions I(x,y), undergo gradient-based edge detection to identify significant brightness transitions. Each edge pixel then "votes" for all possible geometric structures that could contain it. For line detection, edge points (x₀,y₀) generate constraints in (m,b) parameter space through the relation b = y₀ - mx₀. Points lying on the same line create intersecting constraint lines in parameter space, forming accumulator peaks. This approach extends to circles, ellipses, and other parametric shapes by adapting the constraint equations and adding dimensions to the parameter space.
