Topological insulators exhibit an unusual combination of properties: insulating in their bulk yet conducting electricity perfectly along surfaces or edges. This behavior originates from the material's topology, which guarantees protected conductive states resistant to scattering and imperfections. The mathematical concept of topology, concerning properties preserved under continuous deformation, manifests physically in these materials through robust edge states and quantized conductance. These properties arise from spin-orbit coupling and band inversion, creating boundary states that traverse the bulk energy gap and remain protected against perturbations that preserve time-reversal symmetry.
