General relativity reveals gravity as a manifestation of spacetime curvature where time and space metrics are affected by massive objects. As opposed to the depiction of gravity as bending space, like the rubber sheet visualizations, it is actually the gradient in time's passage that creates what appears as gravitational attraction, guiding objects toward regions of slower time. This perspective resolves the apparent force of gravity as a natural consequence of objects following the simplest path through curved time, rather than being pulled by an invisible force.
