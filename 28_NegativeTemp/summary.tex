Temperature fundamentally measures how entropy changes with energy (∂S/∂E), not merely kinetic activity. While unbounded systems like ideal gases can only reach positive temperatures, quantum systems with finite energy spectra reveal a complex structure. When energy addition increases disorder, temperature is positive; when maximum entropy is reached, temperature becomes infinite; further energy addition creates more ordered states with negative temperatures. These negative temperature states are not colder than absolute zero but hotter than infinity — they transfer energy to any positive-temperature system when brought into contact. This phenomenon occurs in systems like spin populations with population inversions, where the highest energy states are more populated than lower ones. The temperature scale forms a complete circle: 0+ → +∞ ≡ -∞ → 0-, with inverse temperature β = 1/(kBT) providing the more natural, continuous parameter.
