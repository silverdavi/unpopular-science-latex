\begin{historical}
The concept of temperature originated long before its formal scientific definition. Early thermometry in the 16th and 17th centuries relied on devices such as Galileo’s thermoscope, which measured qualitative warmth but lacked a standardized scale. By the early 18th century, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit introduced a reliable mercury thermometer and a temperature scale, followed by Anders Celsius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), whose absolute scale based on thermodynamic principles became the foundation for modern temperature measurement.

The theoretical basis for temperature matured alongside the formulation of classical thermodynamics. The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, though articulated last, established the foundational equivalence relation that permits temperature to be meaningfully assigned: if system A is in thermal equilibrium with system B, and system B with system C, then A and C must also be in equilibrium. This abstracted thermal equilibrium from specific substances or instruments, enabling the development of general thermometric devices.

Simultaneously, empirical laws like those of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac revealed regularities in the behavior of gases, hinting at an underlying statistical structure. These culminated in the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), linking temperature with pressure and volume in a measurable way. However, it was not until the advent of statistical mechanics in the 19th century — particularly through the work of Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clerk Maxwell — that temperature gained a microscopic interpretation. Boltzmann’s definition of entropy and the expression \( \frac{1}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial E}\right)_{V,N} \) provided a bridge between macroscopic observations and the probabilistic behavior of particles.

This statistical framework laid the groundwork for interpreting unusual thermodynamic regimes. While classical thermodynamics assumes that entropy increases with energy, leading to strictly positive temperatures, the statistical definition permits a broader spectrum. In systems with bounded energy, entropy can decrease with increasing energy, enabling the formal possibility of negative absolute temperatures. Such interpretations remained largely theoretical until mid-20th century experiments demonstrated their physical reality. The historical evolution of temperature — from sensory perception to empirical measurement, and ultimately to statistical structure — opened the path to understanding these counterintuitive yet rigorously definable states.
