Four dimensions appear repeatedly across physics and mathematics as a critical boundary for stable structures. In three spatial dimensions plus time, inverse-square laws permit stable orbits, quantum field theories remain renormalizable, gauge interactions systematically cancel anomalies, and exotic smooth structures emerge uniquely. This dimensionality enables crucial mathematical frameworks including quaternions, instantons, and black hole uniqueness theorems. Lower dimensions lack sufficient complexity for certain structures, while higher dimensions introduce instabilities and weaken constraints that produce the observable patterns of physical law.
