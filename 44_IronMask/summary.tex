The prisoner known as "Eustache Dauger" remained in state custody for thirty-four years (1669-1703) under extraordinary protocols of secrecy. His confinement spanned four locations under the continuous supervision of a single jailer, Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars. Official correspondence reveals exceptional measures: a specially constructed cell with sound isolation, strict limitations on communication, and a requirement to wear a black velvet mask (not iron) when visible to anyone outside Saint-Mars's control. The prisoner served as valet to another detainee at Pignerol before eventual transfer to the Bastille, where he died and was buried under the alias "Marchioly." No court proceedings, charges, or legal classification appear in records, and following his death, all his possessions and cell surfaces were destroyed — creating a case distinguished not by the known elements but by systematic erasure of official identity.
