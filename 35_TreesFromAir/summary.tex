Trees derive their mass primarily from atmospheric carbon dioxide rather than soil â€” contrary to intuitive belief. Through photosynthesis, plants convert this gaseous carbon into solid form, with approximately 95\% of a tree's dry mass originating from air. Carbon (45-50\%), oxygen (40-45\%), and hydrogen (6\%) constitute the vast majority of wood structure, while soil minerals contribute only 1-5\%. This process transforms diffuse atmospheric gases into the solid structure of forests, demonstrating that substantial physical objects can be essentially materialized air fixed by solar energy.
