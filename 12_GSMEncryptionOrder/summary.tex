GSM mobile communications used the A5/1 \& A5/2 encryption algorithm to protect call privacy, but its implementation revealed how engineering decisions can undermine cryptographic security. The system encrypted data by XORing it with a keystream generated from a 64-bit key, but weaknesses emerged from the protocol's structure rather than the algorithm itself. By encrypting signaling data before voice data, the system exposed predictable message patterns that allowed attackers to recover encryption keys through known-plaintext attacks.
