The exponential function extends far beyond its familiar calculus definitions to form a unifying concept across mathematics. In various contexts: from formal power series to Lie theory, Riemannian geometry to sheaf theory â€” exponential maps share the fundamental property of transforming additive structures into multiplicative or compositional ones. These constructions are not coincidental; each maps linear or infinitesimal information to global or curved structures while preserving key relationships. Whether defined through power series, geodesics, or algebraic homomorphisms, exponential maps express how local linearity extends into global structure, demonstrating how mathematical abstractions reveal patterns across seemingly disparate domains.
