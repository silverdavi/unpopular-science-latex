The body swapping puzzle explores a mathematical problem that gained prominence through the animated series Futurama: when multiple individuals swap minds, can everyone return to their original bodies if no pair can swap directly more than once? This question connects to permutation group theory, where mind swaps represent cycles in permutation notation. The Futurama Theorem, formally known as Keeler's Theorem after writer Ken Keeler, proves that regardless of how complex the initial swapping arrangement, adding two fresh bodies allows any permutation to be sorted with only pairwise swaps.
