Deterministic systems with fixed rules can exhibit chaotic behavior, where minuscule differences in initial conditions lead to drastically different outcomes over time. The double pendulum, three-body gravitational problem, and irregular billiard tables exemplify this phenomenon despite having few components and simple governing equations. Counterintuitively, billions of times more complex physical systems like falling objects often display predictable behavior. This is because dissipative effects — friction, air resistance, and internal vibration — continuously suppress perturbations.
