John Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment challenges computational theories of mind by proposing a scenario where someone manipulates Chinese symbols according to explicit rules without understanding the language. This person could produce appropriate responses to Chinese input, passing a linguistic Turing test, yet possess no comprehension of the conversation's meaning. The argument distinguishes syntax (symbol manipulation) from semantics (understanding), suggesting that digital computers executing algorithms necessarily operate only at the syntactic level. This distinction questions whether systems like large language models truly understand language or merely simulate understanding through statistical pattern recognition, highlighting differences between rule-following behavior and genuine comprehension.
