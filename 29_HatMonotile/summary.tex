In 2023, the "hat" tile discovery resolved the long-standing Einstein problem in tiling theory. This 13-sided polygon covers the plane completely while guaranteeing no pattern repetition, enforcing aperiodicity through geometry alone with just the tile and its mirror image. The breakthrough began with David Smith, an amateur mathematician and tiling enthusiast who noticed unusual behaviors during hands-on experimentation. Working with professional mathematicians, Smith helped develop and verify the formal proofs.
